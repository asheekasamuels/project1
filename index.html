      I am a seasoned worker who has used my experience in the industry to
      develop a leadership brand that precedes myself. I am trusted by my peers,
      and senior leadership because of my consistent commitment to go beyond the
      expectation. My team engagement is admirable, and my greatest strength is
      my ability to build genuine trust relationships with all my peers. I have
      backbone and i am vocal about my opinions always in the best way possible.
      I am not afraid to put in the effort required to deliver, even if it means
      coming in early or on an off day not because i am unable to manage my
      time, but because i always insist on higher standards and knows what it
      takes to achieve those standards. I am also emotionally balanced and
      always approaches situations with an open mind. I always strive to operate
      in the best interest of the business while still managing to factor the
      human elements that contribute to every scenario.
